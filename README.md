# CarValuatorAI ðŸš— - Predict car resale prices accurately

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goal  
CarValuatorAI is a machine learning-powered web application that predicts the resale value of cars based on their features. The aim is to provide car buyers and sellers with a reliable estimate of resale prices, enabling fair and informed decisions in the automobile market.  

---

## ðŸ“– Project Overview  
This project delivers an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for car price prediction:  
- Data preprocessing and cleaning for model-ready inputs.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature impact.  
- Building and tuning a CatBoost Regressor for high-accuracy predictions.  
- Deploying the trained model into a Streamlit application for interactive usage.

---

## ðŸ”„ Project Workflow  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Removed missing and irrelevant values.  
- Converted categorical variables (Fuel Type, Transmission, Seller Type) into dummy variables.  
- Derived car age (`no_year`) from year of manufacture.  
- Selected key features: `Present_Price`, `Kms_Driven`, `Owner`, `no_year`, `Fuel_Type`, `Seller_Type`, and `Transmission`.  

### 2. Model Building  
- Used **CatBoost Regressor** as the core model.  
- Applied **hyperparameter tuning** (iterations, depth, learning rate, etc.) to optimize performance.  
- Final trained model saved as `model.pkl` for deployment.  

### 3. Evaluation Metrics  
- **CatBoost Regressor Performance:**  
  - RÂ² Score: **0.97**  
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): **0.44**  
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): **0.65**  
- The tuned CatBoost model provided excellent accuracy and generalization.  

### 4. Deployment  
- The trained CatBoost model was serialized using `pickle`.  
- A **Streamlit web app** (`app.py`) was built for user interaction.  
- The app allows users to enter details like car price, kilometers driven, ownership, fuel type, transmission, etc. and get instant resale price predictions.  
- Can be deployed on **Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, AWS, or other cloud platforms** for real-time usage.
